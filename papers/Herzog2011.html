</tbody></table><p>The collective recognition heuristic is a simple forecasting heuristic
that bets on the fact that people’s recognition
knowledge of names is a proxy for their competitiveness: In sports, it
predicts that the better-known team or player wins a game. We present
two studies on the predictive power of recognition in forecasting
soccer games (World Cup 2006 and UEFA Euro 2008) and analyze previously
published results. The performance of the collective recognition
heuristic is compared to two benchmarks: predictions based on official
rankings and aggregated betting odds. Across three soccer and two
tennis tournaments, the predictions based on recognition performed
similar to those based on rankings; when compared with betting odds,
the heuristic fared reasonably well. Forecasts based on rankings—but
not on betting odds—were improved by incorporating collective recognition
information. We discuss the use of recognition for forecasting in
sports and conclude that aggregating across individual ignorance spawns
collective wisdom. </p><p><br>

With thousands of bookmakers accepting wagers on sporting events around
the world, today, betting on sports is more popular than ever before.
For example, in 2008 bettors in the UK alone wagered 980 million
British pounds on soccer games—placing over 150 million bets in total
(Gambling Commission, 2009). How should bettors and bookmakers make
forecasts about sporting events? Many different approaches have been
proposed (see e.g., Boulier &amp; Stekler, 1999, 2003; Dixon &amp; Pope,
2004; Goddard, 2005; Lebovic &amp; Sigelman, 2001;
Stefani, 1980). One common denominator is to muster plenty of
knowledge—ranging from various indicators of the strength of
individual players and teams to information about past outcomes, such
as wins, losses—and then predict game scores (e.g., 3:2) or game
outcomes (e.g., team A wins against team B; see e.g., Goddard &amp;
Asimakopoulos, 2004) based on that knowledge.</p><p>Knowledge about teams or players seems indispensable for rendering
accurate forecasts—statistically or informally. Indeed, it seems
absurd to assume that one can successfully predict which tennis player
will win a match if one does not even know most of the names of his or
her competitors in the tournament. Or can one? Surprisingly, there is
mounting evidence that, contrary to Thomas Carlyle’s
intuition, the collective wisdom of individual ignorance genuinely
exists. For instance, in a recent study, the ranks of tennis players
performing in the Wimbledon 2005 tournament—based on how often they
were recognized by 29 amateur tennis players—predicted the match
winners better than the ATP Entry Ranking (Scheibehenne &amp; Bröder,
2007; respondents recognized on average 39% of the
players’ names—thus respondents had far from complete
knowledge). This “wisdom of ignorant
crowds” is one among several examples in sports of
the surprising predictive power of simple heuristics that forgo the
exploitation of ample amounts of knowledge (Bennis &amp; Pachur, 2006;
Goldstein &amp; Gigerenzer, 2009; Gröschner &amp; Raab, 2006).</p><p>The fact that simple forecasting mechanisms can compete with or even
outperform more sophisticated ones is by no means a new insight (e.g.,
Dawes, 1979; Makridakis &amp; Hibon, 1979; see, e.g., Hogarth, in press,
for a review). This finding, however, has been repeatedly met with
resistance; is not widely put to use (see Armstrong, 2005; Goldstein &amp;
Gigerenzer, 2009; Hogarth, in press), and has not yet made it into
popular textbooks of, for example, econometrics (see Hogarth, in press). 
One reason may be the intuitive appeal of the accuracy–effort
trade-off: The less information, computation, or time that one uses,
the less accurate one’s judgments will be. This
trade-off is believed to be one of the few general laws of the human
mind (see Gigerenzer, Hertwig, &amp; Pachur, 2011), and violations of
this law are seen as odd exceptions.</p><p>In the domain of forecasting sports events it is indeed difficult to judge to 
what simple forecasting strategies can outperform more complex ones 
simply because of the dearth of data. In a recent review, Goldstein and 
Gigerenzer (2009) noted that, “there is a need
to test the relative performance of heuristics, experts, and complex
forecasting methods more systematically over the years rather than in
a few arbitrary championships” (p. 766). Focusing on the predictive
power of collective recognition (or ignorance) in sports, this paper
contributes to the literature in four ways. First, it presents two new
studies on the predictive power of recognition in forecasting soccer
games (World Cup 2006 and UEFA Euro 2008). These two studies will show
to what extent the previous results can be replicated (see Evanschitzky &amp; 
Armstrong, 2010; Hyndman, 2010, on the need of replicating
findings in forecasting research). Second, it compares the predictive
power of recognition in these two studies and in previously published
research (reviewed in Goldstein and Gigerenzer, 2009) against two
benchmarks in all tournaments: predictions based on official rankings
(e.g., FIFA for soccer) and aggregated betting odds. Third, we
investigate whether forecasts based on rankings and betting odds can
be improved by incorporating collective recognition
information. Fourth, we investigate the performance of a
recognition-based heuristic that relies on the recognition of
individual names rather than category names (e.g., the names of soccer
players instead of the names of the soccer team itself).</p><p>Last but not least, let us emphasize that our investigation of
collective recognition in the domain of sports should not be taken to
mean that the power of collective recognition is restricted to this
domain. Sports is just one illustrative domain; others are, for
instance, prediction of political elections (e.g., Gaissmaier &amp;
Marewski, 2011), demographic and geographic variables (e.g.,
Goldstein &amp; Gigerenzer, 2002).</p><!--TOC section <FONT SIZE=3>The wisdom of ignorant crowds</FONT>-->
<h2 class="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><a name="htoc2">2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The wisdom of ignorant crowds</h2><!--SEC END --><p>
Does more knowledge make for better forecasters? Research on the value
of expertise in forecasting soccer games, for example, produced mixed
findings: Some studies find that experts outperform novices (e.g.,
Pachur &amp; Biele, 2007), some that they are equally accurate (e.g.,
Andersson, Edman, &amp; Ekman, 2005; Andersson, Memmert, &amp; Popowicz,
2009), and still others find that novices can beat experts (e.g.,
Gröschner &amp; Raab, 2006). Notwithstanding the question of when experts
fare better relative to novices (see e.g., Camerer &amp; Johnson, 1991),
how is it possible that novices can ever outperform experts given that
the former may not even recognize all the teams or players?</p><!--TOC subsection <FONT SIZE=3>The benefits of ignorance</FONT>-->
<h3 class="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><a name="htoc3">2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of ignorance</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
The key to this finding is that recognition or lack thereof is often not
merely random, and thereby can reflect information valuable for
forecasting. For example, successful tennis players are mentioned more
often in the media than less successful ones, thus successful tennis
players are more likely to be recognized by laypeople. As a
consequence, the mere fact that a layperson recognizes one tennis
player, but not another, carries information suggesting that the
recognized one has been more successful in the recent past and thus is
more likely to win the present game than the unrecognized one
(Scheibehenne &amp; Bröder, 2007).</p><p>More generally, whenever some target criterion of a reference class of
objects (e.g., the size of cities, the salary of professional athletes,
or the sales volume of companies) is correlated with the
objects’ exposure in the environment (e.g.,
high-earning athletes are more likely to be mentioned in newspapers;
Hertwig, Herzog, Schooler, &amp; Reimer, 2008), then the criterion will be
mirrored in how often people recognize those objects (Goldstein &amp;
Gigerenzer, 2002; Pachur &amp; Hertwig, 2006; Schooler &amp; Hertwig, 2005). Consequently, recognition
often allows reasonably accurate inferences in sports (for a review see
Goldstein &amp; Gigerenzer, 2009) and in many other domains (for a review
see Pachur, Todd, Gigerenzer, Schooler, &amp; Goldstein, in press).</p><p>Because experts recognize most—if not all—objects in their domain of
expertise (almost by definition), they cannot fall back on partial
ignorance as often as laypeople can (see Pachur &amp; Biele, 2007, for an
example in the soccer domain). Moreover, if the additional knowledge of
experts fails to be more valid than the validity of mere recognition,
then laypeople will be able to outperform experts in terms of accuracy
(Goldstein &amp; Gigerenzer, 2002; but see also Katsikopoulos, 2010;
Pachur, 2010; Pleskac, 2007; Smithson, 2010).<sup><a name="text5" href="http://journal.sjdm.org/11/rh18/rh18.html#note5">2</a></sup> But how
can a forecaster benefit from the potential wisdom encapsulated in
<i>collective</i> ignorance?</p><!--TOC subsection <FONT SIZE=3>Collective recognition heuristic:<BR>

A forecaster who wishes to predict—based on recognition—which of two
contestants (e.g., tennis player, soccer team) will win a game can
employ the <i>collective recognition heuristic </i>(adapted from
Goldstein &amp; Gigerenzer, 2009):</p><blockquote class="quotation">Ask a sample of semi-informed people to 
indicate whether they have heard
of each contestant or not. Rank contestants according to their
recognition rates (i.e., the proportion of people in the sample
recognizing a contestant), and predict, for each game, that the
contestant with the higher rank will win. If the ranks tie, guess.</blockquote><p>The sample of people surveyed should be “semi-informed”; that is, they
should recognize only a subset of the contestants, so that there is
variability in the recognition rates, which—at least
potentially—could predict the outcomes of interest. In contrast to
semi-informed participants, experts are more likely to recognize all
contestants, yielding many recognition rates of 100% and thus ranks
that fail to differentiate between contestants.</p><p>It can, however, be hard to find semi-informed people for the following
reason. With words that designate categories of things or beings, it
can become difficult to discern those of which one has previously heard
from those that one knows exist by logical deduction but has not heard
of before. For example, has one heard before of the category of beings
encompassing the <i>Bolivian</i> soccer team or does one
“recognize” the category name
based on the assumption that all South American countries have a
national soccer team, and by extension, one must have heard of it? In
contrast, it appears much easier to judge whether one has heard of a
word that designates a particular thing (e.g., the Golden Gate Bridge)
or a particular individual in the world (e.g., Roger Federer). A
national soccer team can be seen as a <i>category </i>name, whereas
its players can be seen as particular individuals within that category.
If recognition of category words is more difficult and noisier than
recognition of words designating particular individuals, then the
performance of the collective recognition heuristic using the latter as
input is likely to be better relative to the input in terms of category
names. To investigate this possibility, we introduce the <i>atom
recognition rate </i>that refers to the proportion of
“atoms” (e.g., soccer players)
recognized within a category (e.g., a soccer team). For instance, a
person may recognize only one (4%) of the 23 players of the Bolivian
team, relative to 10 (43%) players of the Brazilian team, but
nevertheless (and correctly) judge that she has heard of both teams
before.</p><p>Assessing the atom recognition rate instead of category recognition
itself can be seen as a decomposition technique for recognition
assessment (see MacGregor, 2001, on decomposition of quantitative
estimates). Single-player sports are, by definition,
“atomistic”. For example, tennis
players are already atoms insofar as they cannot be decomposed into
more meaningful, concrete subordinate components; here, category
recognition and atom recognition overlap conceptually. In team sports,
by contrast, players are the atoms from which their team is built.
The collective recognition heuristic based on the atom recognition rate
proceeds as follows:</p><blockquote class="quotation">Ask a sample of semi-informed people to indicate 
whether they have heard of each “atom” or not. Rank contestants according
to their collective “atom” recognition rates (i.e.,
the mean atom recognition rate of each contestant across atoms and
people surveyed), and predict, for each game, that the contestant with
the higher rank will win. If the ranks tie, guess.</blockquote><!--TOC section <FONT SIZE=3>Method</FONT>-->

Rankings of players or teams based on their past performance are
established and publicly accessible in many sports (e.g., FIFA ranking
for soccer teams, ATP Entry Ranking for tennis players; Stefani, 1997).
Higher-ranked players or teams—not surprisingly—tend to outperform
lower-ranked ones (Boulier &amp; Stekler, 1999; Caudill, 2003; del Corral
&amp; Prieto-Rodríguez, 2010; Klaassen &amp; Magnus, 2003; Lebovic &amp;
Sigelman, 2001; Scheibehenne &amp; Bröder, 2007; Serwe &amp; Frings, 2006; 
Smith &amp; Schwertman, 1999; Suzuki &amp; Ohmori, 2008). In
line with other researchers (e.g., Serwe &amp; Frings, 2006; Suzuki &amp;
Ohmori, 2008), we use the accuracy of a <i>ranking rule </i>that
predicts that the better-ranked team or player will win a game; if the
ranks tie, the rule will guess. We use the most recent ranking
published before the start of a tournament.</p><!--TOC subsubsection <FONT SIZE=3>Odds rule</FONT>-->
<h4 class="subsubsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><a name="htoc8">3.1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Odds rule</h4><!--SEC END --><p>
Betting odds are highly predictive of sport outcomes (e.g., Boulier,
Stekler, &amp; Amundson, 2006; Forrest &amp; McHale, 2007; Gil &amp; Levitt,
2007). We will use an <i>odds rule</i> that predicts that the team or
player with the higher probability of victory (as revealed by
aggregated odds) will win a game; if the odds tie, the rule will guess.
We interpret the performance of this rule as an—admittedly
crude—approximation of the predictability of a
tournament.<sup><a name="text6" href="http://journal.sjdm.org/11/rh18/rh18.html#note6">3</a></sup></p><p>There are three reasons why the odds rule will—in the long
run—generally perform better than collective recognition and ranking
rules, and thus represents an upper benchmark. First, betting
markets are generally unbiased predictors of game outcomes (e.g.,
Sauer, 1998). Although bookmaker betting markets might not be
completely efficient (e.g., Franck, Verbeek, &amp; Nüesch, 2010;
Vlastakis, Dotsis, &amp; Markellos, 2009, for soccer bets), they are very
effective in absorbing publicly available information (see Forrest,
Goddard, &amp; Simmons, 2005). Second, because bookmakers of online
betting sites are allowed to update their odds right up until the start
of each game, they can absorb very recent information. Betting odds
thus have an informational advantage over strategies based on
information that is “frozen” before the start of a tournament (Vlastakis 
et al., 2009)—such as
recognition and rankings. Third, averaging odds over many different
bookmakers has the advantage of canceling out strategic and
unintentional inefficiencies of individual bookmakers (for a discussion
about why different bookmakers’ odds may vary, see
Vlastakis et al., 2009; for a discussion of the benefits of combining
probability assessments, see e.g., Clemen &amp; Winkler, 1999; Winkler,
1971; on the performance of aggregated odds to forecast soccer match
results, see e.g., Hvattum &amp; Arntzen, 2010; Leitner, Zeileis, &amp;
Hornik, 2010).</p><!--TOC subsection <FONT SIZE=3>Comparing performance across studies</FONT>-->
<h3 class="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><a name="htoc9">3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing performance across studies</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
Different sports vary in terms of predictability. For example, outcomes
of soccer and baseball games are less predictable based on a
team’s past performance relative to ice hockey,
basketball and American football (Ben-Naim, Vazquez, &amp; Redner, 2006). Thus, the
proportion of games predicted correctly can be directly compared across
different strategies for a given tournament but not across different
sports—or across different tournaments within the same sport, because
even tournaments might differ in their predictability. To enable
comparisons across different sports and tournaments, we introduce two
performance measures that address those differences in predictability
by taking into account the forecasts of a “gold
standard” benchmark. We use aggregated betting odds
as such a gold standard.</p><p>First, we analyze the <i>signal performance</i> of a strategy. This
measure evaluates the proportion of correct forecasts of a strategy
among those games where the gold standard (i.e., odds) predicted the
winner of a game.<sup><a name="text7" href="http://journal.sjdm.org/11/rh18/rh18.html#note7">4</a></sup> The assumption is that the results of those games are less
likely due to chance than those of games where the gold standard was
wrong. The signal performance thus assesses a
strategy’s ability to predict “what
can be predicted” (i.e., true signals as opposed to
noise). In doing so, this measure makes the performance of strategies
across domains with different predictability (i.e., amount of noise)
more comparable.</p><p>Second, we analyze the <i>normalized performance index (NPI)</i>. It
expresses the performance of the target strategy as a fraction of the
“gold standard” performance (i.e.,
odds) corrected for chance as follows:</p><blockquote class="quote"><i>NPI</i> = <i>accuracy</i>&nbsp;&#8722;&nbsp;50%/<i>gold standard performance</i>&nbsp;&#8722;&nbsp;50%
</blockquote><p>We assume that the gold standard performance is larger than 50%,
otherwise the NPI is either undefined (= 50%) or not interpretable
(&lt; 50%). An NPI of 0 indicates that the target strategy is
at chance performance; a value of 1 indicates that it measures up to
the gold standard. If a strategy scored, for example, 60% and the gold
standard 70% correct predictions, the resulting NPI will be .5. Values
above 1 indicate performance above the gold standard.</p><!--TOC subsection <FONT SIZE=3>World Cup Soccer 2006 study</FONT>-->

We analyzed the performance of the collective recognition heuristic and
the benchmarks in our two studies and in three published studies on the
predictive power of recognition in sports that Goldstein and Gigerenzer
(2009) reviewed. Two of the latter studies investigated
Wimbledon Gentlemen’s Singles tennis tournaments: 2003
(Serwe &amp; Frings, 2006) and 2005 (Scheibehenne &amp; Bröder, 2007). Both
studies used two rankings as benchmarks: the <i>ATP
Champions Race Ranking</i> (based on the games from the current
calendar year) and the <i>ATP Entry Ranking </i>(based on the games
from the previous 52 weeks)<sup><a name="text10" href="http://journal.sjdm.org/11/rh18/rh18.html#note10">7</a></sup>. Serwe and Frings (2006) used odds from a single
bookmaker (expekt.com). Scheibehenne and Bröder (2007) used odds from five
bookmakers (bet365.com, centrebet.com, expekt.com, interwetten.com, and
pinnaclesports.com); we used the average of the five bookmakers. </p><p>One other study investigated the UEFA Euro 2004
soccer championship (Pachur &amp; Biele, 2007). We collected 2004 pre-tournament FIFA rankings
(FIFA.com, 2010a, 2010b) and aggregated 2004 pre-game betting odds (Betexplorer.com,
2010c). Using the studies’ raw data and the data that
we retrieved online, we calculated the performance statistics reported
in Tables 1 and 2.</p><p>In the knock-out phase of a soccer tournament, the betting odds refer to
the result at the end of regular time (90 minutes plus added time) and
not to the final result of the game (possibly including extra time and
penalty shooting). To ensure that the odds predict the actual winners
of the games, we only included the group games in the soccer
tournaments. In addition, we excluded soccer games that ended in a draw
because the recognition-based heuristics and the ranking rule cannot
predict a draw<sup><a name="text11" href="http://journal.sjdm.org/11/rh18/rh18.html#note11">8</a></sup>.</p><!--TOC section <FONT SIZE=3>Results and discussion</FONT>-->

The names of tennis players already designate individuals rather than
categories, therefore the distinction between category recognition and
atom recognition disappears in the domain of tennis. Table 2 reports
the performance statistics for the two tennis tournaments across
strategies. Across soccer and tennis tournaments (Tables 1 and 2), the
collective recognition heuristic based on the names of individual
soccer or tennis players outperformed the ranking rules in six
comparisons, tied in one and yielded in five comparisons. The signal
performance of the collective recognition heuristic ranged from 66% to
86% (<i>Mdn</i> = 78%, CI<sup><a name="text13" href="http://journal.sjdm.org/11/rh18/rh18.html#note13">10</a></sup> [.73, .85])—that of the ranking rules
from 69% to 92% (<i>Mdn</i> = 75%, CI [.72, .85]). Not surprisingly,
the odds rule outperformed the collective recognition heuristic in all
eight comparisons; it also beat the ranking rules in six out of seven
comparison and tied in the remaining one. The collective recognition
heuristic’s normalized performance indices (NPIs) in
the eight tournaments ranged from 0.49 to 0.83 (<i>Mdn</i> = 0.76, CI
[0.58, 0.83])—that is, the collective recognition heuristic achieved,
on average, about three fourths of the odds rules’s
performance. As a comparison, the NPIs of the ranking rules ranged from
0.45 to 1.00 (<i>Mdn </i>= 0.62, CI [0.49, 0.79]).</p><blockquote class="table"><div class="center"><hr width="80%" size="2"></div>

tournaments, see Table 1) outperformed the ranking rule in three of
four comparisons and yielded signal performance measures of 65%, 81%,
85%, and 88%. In three out of four cases, the odds rule performed
better than the collective recognition heuristic (NPIs: 0.63, 0.71,
0.71 and 1.36).</p><p>Comparing the variability in performance of all strategies in the soccer
(Table 1) and the tennis tournaments (Table 2) reveals that the results
in tennis seem to be more stable than those in soccer. One possible
reason is that the latent “real”
competitiveness of tennis players is more reliably assessed than that
of soccer teams for two reasons. First, the tennis tournaments feature
a larger set of games than the soccer tournaments and, second, within a
tennis match there are more opportunities for the latent skill to
reveal itself than in a soccer game (i.e., many more serves and points
in tennis than goal opportunities and actual goals in soccer).</p><p>To put the performance of recognition into perspective, it is
illustrative to compare it to the performance of the recognition
heuristic in domains outside sport. The proportion of correct forecasts
based on collective (atom) recognition ranged between 60% and 84%
across the 12 samples analyzed in this paper (<i>Mdn</i> = 65%, CI
[.62, .69]). Similarly, people’s median individual
recognition validity (i.e., the median proportion of times the recognition
cue made a correct prediction based on an individual’s recognition
knowledge among all non-drawn games) ranged between 56%
and 79% (<i>Mdn</i> = 67%, CI [.59, .71]; see Tables 3 and 4). In
five representative environments investigated by Hertwig et al. (2008),
the recognition validities ranged from 61% (cumulative record sales of
music artists), 67% (wealth of billionaires), 69% (earnings of
athletes), 70% (revenue of German companies) to 83% (population size
of U.S. cities). This comparison suggests that the predictiveness of
recognition may be comparable in the domains of sport, economics, and
geography.</p><!--TOC subsection <FONT SIZE=3>The benefits of aggregating ignorance</FONT>-->
<h3 class="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><a name="htoc22">4.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of aggregating ignorance</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
The collective recognition and the collective atom recognition heuristic
use the aggregated ignorance of a group of people to make predictions.
In contrast, the recognition heuristic uses the recognition knowledge
of a single person (Goldstein &amp; Gigerenzer, 2002). But why aggregate?
The benefits of aggregating ignorance are two-fold.</p><p>First, it increases the applicability of recognition-based heuristics
(that is, the proportion of cases where a prediction can be made) and
thus reduces the proportion of cases where the heuristic resorts to
guessing because both objects have the same recognition value. Tables
3 and 4 summarize several measures calculated on the level of
individual participants for the soccer and tennis tournaments: the
recognition rate (i.e., proportion of team or player names recognized), the
applicability rate (i.e., proportion of games where the recognition
cue was not tied; that is, where it allowed a prediction), the
recognition accuracy (i.e., the proportion of correct forecasts,
assuming that a forecaster guesses when the recognition cue is tied),
and the recognition validity (i.e., the proportion of correct
forecasts only for those games where the recognition cue was
<i>not</i> tied; see Goldstein &amp; Gigerenzer, 2002). As can be seen
in Tables 1 to 4, in all 12 samples in this study, the applicability
of the collective heuristics was higher than that of the participants’ individual 
heuristic (i.e., applicability of the recognition heuristic). This difference is most
pronounced for the collective recognition heuristic in the UEFA Euro
2008 tournament. Here, the median participant recognized all names of
the soccer teams (see Table 3) and thus could never apply the
recognition heuristic, whereas the collective recognition heuristic
could be applied in almost all games (see Table 1). In contrast,
because an individual’s <i>atom</i> recognition rate for a soccer
team can take graded values between 0 and 1, the individual atom
recognition heuristic could be applied almost as often as the
collective atom recognition heuristic (86% for the median participant
vs. 100% for the collective atom recognition heuristic, see Tables 1
and 3).</p><blockquote class="table"><div class="center"><hr width="80%" size="2"></div>

<div class="center"><hr width="80%" size="2"></div></blockquote><p>The second benefit of aggregating recognition judgments is that it
creates a “portfolio of ignorance”. People may recognize a team or a player
for reasons that are unrelated to the team’s or
player’s competitiveness (e.g., a widely discussed
extramarital affair; or because the name is a common name, or because
of random error in the recognition judgment; see also Pleskac, 2007). To the extent that
different people’s recognition knowledge represents
different “errors”, those errors
will tend to cancel out when aggregating recognition judgments; this
benefit of error cancellation by aggregation has been widely discussed
in the forecasting (e.g., Armstrong, 2001; Clemen, 1989) and machine
learning literature (e.g., Dietterich, 2000). As an illustration of the
benefit of error cancellation, consider recognition of
the names of soccer players in the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament. We
compared the accuracy of an individual participant’s
recognition heuristic (i.e., recognition validity) with the accuracy of
the collective atom recognition heuristic for only those games where

German (79%, CI [.70, .86]) and international participants (72%, CI

collective atom recognition heuristic. This superiority of collective
atom recognition reflects error cancellation and not a higher
applicability of the collective heuristic.</p><blockquote class="table"><div class="center"><hr width="80%" size="2"></div>

<h3 class="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><a name="htoc23">4.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Does collective recognition improve the
forecasts based on rankings and betting odds?</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
The collective recognition heuristic enables predictions that are on par
with those of official rankings in the studies analyzed. One could
therefore conclude that rankings should be preferred to collective
recognition because the former are easier to obtain than the latter
(see the general discussion for a broader discussion of this topic).
But could it be that collective recognition contains predictive
information that goes beyond that contained in rankings? That is, could
one combine rankings with collective recognition and arrive at
predictions that are superior to those based on rankings alone?
Furthermore, could collective recognition similarly improve forecasts
based on betting odds?</p><p>To answer these questions, we compared regression models of the
strategies proper (i.e., collective recognition heuristic, ranking
rule, and odds rule), relative to regression models combining
recognition with rankings and odds, respectively. Specifically, we
conducted a series of logistic (logit) regression models that was built on
the following logic (see del Corral &amp; Prieto-Rodríguez, 2010): For
each of the strategies proper, we defined a measure (explained below)
indicating how strongly the strategy favored what it determined to be
the winner. Using these measures, we next determined whether the
strategies were indeed more likely to be right when they had a stronger
favorite. Reiterating the same procedure, we finally analyzed whether
the performance of the ranking and the odds rule improved when
recognition was added as an additional predictor. Because of the small
number of games in the soccer tournaments and the heterogeneity of the
strategies’ performance (see Table 1), making it
impossible to pool across tournaments, we did not obtain robust results
for this domain. The following analysis thus only concerns the tennis
tournaments. To simplify the analyses, we averaged the two ATP rankings
(Champions Race Ranking and Entry Ranking) into one overall ATP ranking
and pooled the two tournaments (including a dummy variable coding for
the games of the 2005 tournament) in all regression models. We also
averaged the collective recognition rates from the experts and
laypeople before computing the collective recognition rankings.
Separate analyses for the two tournaments, the two rankings, and the
two participant pools (experts vs. laypeople) yielded qualitatively
similar results.</p><p>In the analyses, we used the log ratio of the ATP
rankings—lower-ranked player divided by the higher-ranked player—as
a measure of how strongly the ranking rule predicted the win to
occur. This log ratio successfully predicts the probability that a
better-ranked tennis player defeats a lower-ranked player (see e.g.,
del Corral &amp; Prieto-Rodríguez, 2010, for an analysis of 4,064 Grand
Slam tennis matches from 2005 to 2008). For collective recognition, we
ranked the players according to their collective recognition rates and
also used the log ratio of the ranks: lower-ranked player divided by
the higher-ranked player. Those two log ratio measures imply that the
same absolute difference in ranks is—by taking the ratio—more
important the higher ranked both players are and that the importance of
the proportional difference between two ranks is subject to—by taking
the logarithm—diminishing marginal increases.</p><p>Betting odds can be understood as revealed probability judgments and can
be converted into “as-if”
probabilities by taking the reciprocal of the decimal odds (see e.g.,
Vlastakis et al., 2009, eq. 2). We calculated these probabilities, made
sure that they add up to 1 for each game—their sum is smaller than 1
because bookmakers want to ensure a stable income from the margin
(Vlastakis et al., 2009)—and then calculated odds ratios conditioned on the
player with the better odds of winning the game. Because the odds
ratios were strongly skewed, we used log odds ratios for the analyses.</p><p>We ran a baseline model for each of the three strategies that predicted
whether or not the strategy’s forecast was correct
based on the respective strategy’s predictor variable
(“ATP.win &#8764; ATP”,
“Odds.win &#8764; Odds” and
“REC.win &#8764; REC”). Two models
(“ATP.win &#8764; ATP + REC” and
“Odds.win &#8764; Odds + REC”) tested
to what extent the addition of collective recognition rankings improved
accuracy, relative to the ATP ranking and the odds alone. For the
latter two models, the ratio of the recognition rankings needs to be
defined in the same way as the respective target ratio (ATP and Odds):
That is, we divided the recognition ranking of the player with the
worse ATP ranking (worse odds) by the recognition ranking of the player
with the better ATP ranking (better odds).</p><blockquote class="table"><div class="center"><hr width="80%" size="2"></div>

(BIC; Raftery, 1995) and Brier scores (Brier, 1950; Yates, 1982,
1994)—a measure of the quality of probabilistic forecasts where lower
values indicate better forecasts.<sup><a name="text15" href="http://journal.sjdm.org/11/rh18/rh18.html#note15">12</a></sup> We
ran a cross-validation simulation where we fitted the five models to a
random two thirds of the games and then—using the fitted
parameters—predicted the outcomes of the remaining third; we repeated
that procedure for 100,000 cross-validation samples. Table 5 reports
three Brier scores for each model: the score based on the full sample
(column “All”) and the average
scores for the learning dataset (column
“Fit”) and the test dataset
(column “Test”) across all
cross-validation samples. The standard errors of the Brier scores in
the cross-validation simulation were smaller than .00011.</p><p>Four results emerged. First, the larger the differences between the
ranks or odds of two players, the more likely that the
strategy’s forecast was correct, as indicated by the
positive slopes of the predictors in the three baseline models. The
slopes in a logit regression model can be converted into odds ratios of
a “unit change” on the predictor
variable by plugging the slopes into the exponential function. For the
ATP model, for example, the odds of the better-ranked player winning
against the lower-ranked player are e<sup>0.50</sup>; that is,
1.66 times higher for a pair of players with a log ratio that is one
unit larger than that of an another pair of players. The respective odds
ratios are 2.08 and 1.54 for the log odds ratios of the betting odds
and the log ratios of the collective recognition rankings,
respectively.</p><p>Second, whereas the probability forecasts of the ATP rankings and the
collective recognition rankings were comparable in terms of the
cross-validated Brier scores (.212 and .211), those of the betting odds
were clearly superior (.158). The recognition model yielded a better
Brier score, relative to the ATP model's Brier score,
in only 52% of the cross-validation samples. In contrast, the odds
model yielded a better score, as compared with both the ATP and the
recognition model, in 99% of the samples. The BIC of the odds model is
59 units lower than that of the other two models, which indicates
“very strong” evidence in support
of the odds model (see Raftery, 1995, pp. 138–139).</p><p>Third, adding recognition rankings to the ATP rankings improved
forecasts relative to the ATP rankings only: the cross-validated Brier
score dropped from .212 to .204. The combined model achieved a better
score in 82% of the cross-validation samples. The BIC decreased by
4.0—indicating that the data are roughly 8 times
(e<sup>4.0/2 </sup>= 7.56) more likely assuming the combined
model as compared to the ATP model. Assuming that both models are
equally likely a priori, this implies a posterior probability of the
combined model of 88% (see Wagenmakers, 2007, pp. 796–797).</p><p>Fourth, adding recognition rankings to the betting odds did not improve
forecasts relative to odds only. It actually led to worse forecasts.
The cross-validated Brier score increased from .158 to .161. The
combined model achieved a worse score in 62% of the cross-validation
samples. The BIC increased by 5.4, indicating that the data are roughly
15 times (e<sup>5.4/2 </sup>= 14.92) more likely assuming the
simple as compared to the combined model. The posterior probability of
the simple model is 94%, assuming equal priors.</p><!--TOC section <FONT SIZE=3>General discussion</FONT>-->
<h2 class="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><a name="htoc24">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;General discussion</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Our replications and analyses of previous studies have yielded four
major findings. First, in the three soccer and the two tennis
tournaments the collective recognition heuristic enables forecasts that
consistently perform above chance, and that are as accurate as
predictions based on official rankings (Tables 1 and 2). Second, we
compared the performance of the collective recognition heuristic based
on the recognition of category names (the soccer team’s
name) and names of individual soccer players for the UEFA Euro 2008
tournament and did not find appreciable differences in their
performance (Table 1). Apparently in this tournament, the recognition
of category words is no less reliable or valid than the recognition of
words designating particular individuals. Third, aggregated betting
odds, on average, are superior to predictions based on rankings or
collective recognition (Tables 1, 2, and 5). This result, however, was
to be expected due to the informational advantage of betting odds (see
e.g., Vlastakis et al., 2009). Fourth, in the two tennis tournaments,
the collective recognition heuristic, the ATP and the odds rule were
more likely to render correct forecasts the larger the differences on
their respective predictors. This implies that the larger the difference in 
the ranks of, for example, recognition rates, the more confident a forecaster 
can be in her predictions. Moreover, the forecasts of the ATP rule—but not
those of the odds rule—can be improved by incorporating collective
recognition rankings into the forecast.</p><!--TOC subsection <FONT SIZE=3>When should one use the wisdom of<BR>
ignorant crowds?</FONT>-->
<h3 class="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><a name="htoc25">5.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;When should one use the wisdom of<br>
ignorant crowds?</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
In domains where established and valid rankings or betting odds are
available, the most straightforward approach seems to use those
rankings or odds to render forecasts. The effort of collecting
recognition judgments does not seem to pay off when those
alternative—already conveniently pre-calculated—cues are available.
In practice, however, the collective (atom) recognition is still an
attractive option for at least three reasons.</p><p>First, in some domains forecasters might not trust the predictive
ability of a ranking system because they may feel that the logic behind the 
system is partially flawed. For example, up to the World Cup 2006, the
FIFA ranking was based on games from the last 8 years and many
commentators felt that it did not adequately reflect the
<i>current</i> strength of the teams (BBC Sport, 2000). The ranking
system was later revised to only encompass the last 4 years (FIFA.com,
2010a). In addition, some ranking systems—by their very design—may 
reflect more than merely the latent skills of the contestants. For example, because the 
ATP ranking system awards more points for matches in more prestigious 
tournaments (Stefani, 1997), there is an incentive to play many matches in 
such tournaments. These and other incentives may lower a ranking’s ability 
to predict future winners. Second, as our analysis of the two tennis 
tournaments suggests, the predictions based on ranking information may 
be improved by incorporating collective recognition information. Such a 
combined use of rankings and collective recognition is especially attractive 
when forecasters are unsure about the trustworthiness of the ranking system
and would like to diversify the risk of relying on bad information by
including additional, non-redundant information into their predictions
(see also Graefe &amp; Armstrong, 2009, on a combined use of
recognition-like information, rankings, and betting odds in tennis
tournaments). Third, betting odds might not be available at the time
when forecasters render their predictions. In sports, betting odds are
usually only available for those games for which it is known who will
play whom. At the start of tournaments with a later knock-out phase
(e.g., UEFA Euro and World Cup Soccer tournaments), one can only bet on
the outcomes of the round-robin games, but not on the later knock-out
phase because it is not yet known who will encounter whom. Only when
the tournament moves to the next stage will bookmakers offer new bets
on those games.</p><p>The results of our analyses suggest that in the domains of soccer and
tennis—and possibly also in other domains—collective (atom)
recognition can be expected to achieve about three fourths of the
performance of aggregated betting odds and to be on par with official
ranking systems. Thus when rankings and odds are not trustworthy or
available, collective recognition is an alternative and frugal
forecasting option.</p><p>But when should one <i>not </i>use collective recognition and switch
to other approaches? People’s recognition knowledge
mirrors how often they encountered names (e.g., Goldstein &amp; Gigerenzer,
2002; Hertwig et al., 2008) and the probability of encountering a
particular name partly depends on how
“important” that name is in
people’s environment (e.g., people write and read, on
average, more about successful companies and athletes than about less
successful ones; Hertwig et al., 2008; Scheibehenne &amp; Bröder, 2007).
We can thus expect recognition generally to be a valid cue in the
domain of sports and in many other domains in which the criterion
dimension (e.g., size, wealth, or success) matters to the public. By
the same token, however, one should refrain from using collective
recognition for obscure criteria that are of little interest to people
and where there thus will be no correlation between the criterion and
recognition (e.g., shoe size of tennis players and their name
recognition; see also Pohl, 2006).</p><!--TOC subsection <FONT SIZE=3>Whom to ask and how many?</FONT>-->
<h3 class="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><a name="htoc26">5.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom to ask and how many?</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
If a forecaster decides to use the collective (atom) recognition
heuristic, two main questions arise: Whom to ask and how many?
Regarding the first question, forecasters should collect responses from
a diverse set of respondents that have been exposed to different
information environments. In the same way that, for example, economic
experts from different schools of thought (and thus likely exposed to
different information and assumptions) have errors that are less correlated 
than those of experts from the same school of thought (Batchelor &amp; Dua, 1995),
the errors in recognition judgments from a diverse set of people may also
be less correlated than the errors of similar people. This means that 
errors are more likely to cancel out with a diverse set of people. The finding that
the collective recognition heuristic fared better with recognition
judgments stemming from respondents from all over the world than with
recognition judgments stemming from Swiss or German respondents in the
UEFA Euro 2008 tournament highlights the importance of non-redundant
recognition judgments. The prescription of using recognition data from
different sources mirrors Armstrong’s (2001) principle
of using “different data or different
methods” (p. 419) when combining forecasts.</p><p>How many people should you survey? This question can be rephrased as:
How large should the sample size be so that the estimates of the true
recognition rates are reasonably reliable? Because the benefit of
adding an additional binary observation (i.e., recognized the name
vs. did not recognize the name) in terms of accurately assessing the
population value decreases with increasing sample size, we suspect that
most of the gains in predictive power can be achieved with a few dozen
observations. When using atom recognition, the necessary sample size
might be even lower because estimation error will already cancel out
when aggregating the atom recognition rates within a category (e.g.,
from the player names to the soccer team).</p><!--TOC subsection <FONT SIZE=3>How can one use the wisdom of ignorant crowds even when there

<h3 class="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><a name="htoc27">5.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can one use the wisdom of ignorant crowds even when there
is no crowd available?</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
Given the predictive advantage of aggregating ignorance, how could a
single forecaster still profit from a crowd’s ignorance
even when no crowd is available? We recently showed that individual people can 
simulate a “crowd within” to improve their quantitative judgments
using <i>dialectical bootstrapping</i> (Herzog &amp; Hertwig, 2009)—thus 
emulating a social heuristic (see Hertwig &amp; Herzog, 2009):
Canceling out error by averaging their first estimate with a second,
dialectical one that uses different assumptions and is thus likely to
have an error of different sign. We speculate that individual
forecasters could simulate the “wisdom of ignorant
crowds” within their own mind by, for example,
estimating the proportion of people among a specified reference class
(e.g., one’s family and friends or a representative
sample of residents from a country) who would recognize team or player
names. In the same way, however, that the errors of two different
people’s estimates are more independent than the errors
of two estimates from the same person (e.g., Herzog &amp; Hertwig, 2009),
we suspect that recognition knowledge from different people is more
independent than the recognition knowledge of a simulated crowd.</p><p>Another approach is to look for proxies of people’s
recognition knowledge. Frequencies of name mentions in large text corpi
(e.g., number of hits on google.com or in online newspaper archives)
are good proxies of recognition data (see e.g., Goldstein &amp;
Gigerenzer, 2002; Hertwig et al., 2008) and very easy and quick to
collect. Predicting for the Wimbledon 2005 tournament, for example,
that a game will be won by the tennis player mentioned more often in
the sports section of the German newspapers <i>Tagesspiegel</i> or
<i>Süddeutsche Zeitung </i>(during the 12 months prior to the start
of the tournament) was almost, but not quite as predictive as
collective recognition (Scheibehenne &amp; Bröder, 2007). Also, the
frequency with which users enter names into search engines—another
proxy for how well known and important objects are—can be used to
predict events. For example, across the 1,016 matches of the eight
Grand Slam tennis tournaments in 2007 and 2008, the tennis player who
was searched for more often won 70% of the games (Graefe &amp; Armstrong,
2009). As a comparison, a ranking rule (based on the ATP Entry Ranking)
predicted 72% and odds rules based on five different online bookmakers
between 77% and 79% of the matches correctly.</p><!--TOC section <FONT SIZE=3>Conclusion</FONT>-->
<h2 class="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><a name="htoc28">6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</h2><!--SEC END --><p>
Collective recognition is a simple forecasting heuristic that bets on
the fact that people’s recognition knowledge of names
of competitors is a proxy for their competitiveness. The use of the
collective recognition heuristic is, of course, not limited to the
domain of sports. It can be applied in virtually any domain for
criteria that matter to the public and thus are likely to be reflected
in people’s knowledge and ignorance about the world.
The Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle did
“(...) not believe in the collective wisdom of individual ignorance” in
political decision making. A small but growing set of data suggests
that had he considered the forecasting of sport events, he might have
placed more trust into the collective wisdom of individual ignorance.</p><!--TOC section <FONT SIZE=3>References</FONT>-->
